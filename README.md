### Hi there 👋

I'm Sophie, a web developer with a background of 12 years in project management. 
I have a passion for design and catering the needs and calming the fears of non-technical-affine clients, as I was one of them not too long ago 🐤. 
Now that I switched to the other side, I love everything about tech and eager to learn more 🤓!

- 🚀 Soon-to-be UpLeveled bootcamp graduate
- 🔭 I’m currently working on 'plant heroes', a plantsitting platform for Viennese citizens who don't want a dead plant after they return from their vacation
- 🌱 Tech Stack: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, PostgresQL, REST API and many more
